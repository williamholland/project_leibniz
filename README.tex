\section{Prerequisites}

The aim of this project is not to teach calculus from scratch, students should
have been exposed to the basic ideas including

\begin{itemize}
	\item The power law of derivatives
	\item The chain rule
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure}

This project is divided into two main sections: differential and integral calculus. Within each section there are 4 levels which are defined as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \input{level_1_intro}
	\item \input{level_2_intro}
	\item \input{level_3_intro}
	\item \input{level_4_intro}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contribute}

There are several ways you can contribute:

If you are a student:
\begin{itemize}
	\item * we would love feedback on the appropriacy and difficulty of the problems
\end{itemize}

Graduates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item attempt the problems to find any errors that may have slipped in
	\item contribute interesting new problems
\end{itemize}

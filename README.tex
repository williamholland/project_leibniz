\section{Prerequisites}

The aim of this project is not to teach calculus from scratch, students should
have been exposed to the basic ideas including

\begin{itemize}
	\item The power law of derivatives
	\item The chain rule
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure}

This project is divided into two main sections: differential and integral calculus. Within each section there are 4 levels which are defined as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Level one: The difficulty is approximately aimed at people who
	are very new to calculus. Problems only involve two variables i.e. IGCSE
	extended maths or equivalent
	\item Level two: The difficulty is approximately designed to challenge
	gifted 16 year olds i.e. IGCSE additional maths or equivalent
	\item Level three: The difficulty is aimed at A-level, IB maths
	students or equivalent
	\item Level four: This is for people looking to sharpen their skills
	prior to begining university
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contribute}

There are several ways you can contribute:

If you are a student:
\begin{itemize}
	\item * we would love feedback on the appropriacy and difficulty of the problems
\end{itemize}

Graduates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item attempt the problems to find any errors that may have slipped in
	\item contribute interesting new problems
\end{itemize}

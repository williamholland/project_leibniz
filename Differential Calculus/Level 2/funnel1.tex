A conical funnel has a diameter of $4cm$ and a height of $6cm$. Water flows out of the bottom of the funnel at a rate of $2cm^3/s$.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The volume of a cone is given by $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$, find the capacity of the funnel (the maximum volume of water it can hold).
	\item When the cone contains water the shape of the water makes a cone even when the funnel is not full. This smaller cone of water is related to the full volume of the funnel because the ratio between the radius of the cross-section and the height of the cone is constant. Let $w$ represent the height of water in the funnel and $\rho$ represent the radius of the cross-section at that height then we have the equation $$\frac{\rho}{w} = \text{constant}$$
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item Find the value of this constant for this cone by using the situation when then cone is full of water.
	    \item Write down a formula for the radius of the cross-section of the cone $\rho$ when the water level is $w$ cm
	    \item Hence, write an expression for the volume of water in the cup in terms of $w$
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Hence, find an expression for the rate of change of volume $V$ in terms of the rate of change of $w$
	\item The volume of water that flows out of the funnel every second is $2cm^3$. Write down $\frac{dV}{dt}$.
	\item Hence find the rate of change of $w$ - how fast is the water level dropping - when the funnel is filled with water to $w=3cm$.
\end{enumerate}

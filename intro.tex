\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is Project Leibniz?}

Project Leibniz is a collection of real-world motivated maths problems aimed at
secondary students to illustrate the power of calculus.

Calculus has a reputation as being abstract, impenetrable and poorly
understood. Many secondary students struggle with this topic because it is not
taught well. The aim of this project is to allow students to improve their
calculus skills by practicing with real-world problems to inspire their
curiosity and help them retain the knowledge.

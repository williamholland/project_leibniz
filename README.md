# Project Leibniz

A collection of real-world motivated maths problems aimed at secondary students
to illustrate the power of calculus.

## Introduction

Calculus has a reputation as being abstract, impenetrable and poorly
understood. Many secondary students struggle with this topic because it is not
taught well. The aim of this project is to allow students to improve their
calculus skills by practicing with real-world problems to inspire their
curiosity and help them retain the knowledge.

## Prerequisites

The aim of this project is not to teach calculus from scratch, students should
have been exposed to the basic ideas including

* The power law of derivatives
* The chain rule

## Structure

This project is divided into two main sections: differential and integral calculus. Within each section there are 4 levels which are defined as:

1. Level one: The difficulty is approximately aimed at people who are very new to calculus. Problems only involve two variables i.e. IGCSE extended maths or equivalent
1. Level two: The difficulty is approximately designed to challenge gifted 16
   year olds i.e. IGCSE additional maths or equivalent
1. Level three: The difficulty is aimed at A-level, IB maths students or equivalent
1. Level four: This is for people looking to sharpen their skills prior to starting university

## Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

If you are a student:
* we would love feedback on the appropriacy and difficulty of the problems

Graduates:
* attempt the problems to find any errors that may have slipped in
* contribute interesting new problems

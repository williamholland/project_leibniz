What is Project Leibniz?
------------------------

Project Leibniz is a collection of real-world motivated maths problems
aimed at secondary students to illustrate the power of calculus.

Calculus has a reputation as being abstract, impenetrable and poorly
understood. Many secondary students struggle with this topic because it
is not taught well. The aim of this project is to allow students to
improve their calculus skills by practicing with real-world problems to
inspire their curiosity and help them retain the knowledge.

Prerequisites
=============

The aim of this project is not to teach calculus from scratch, students
should have been exposed to the basic ideas including

-   The power law of derivatives

-   The chain rule

Structure
=========

This project is divided into two main sections: differential and
integral calculus. Within each section there are 4 levels which are
defined as:

1.  Level one aimed at people who are new to calculus.

2.  Level two is designed to challenge advanced secondary students and
    beyond. For example an IGCSE additional maths student. You should be
    familiar with problems involving related rates of change.

3.  Level three is aimed at motived secondary level students and beyond.
    For example A-level further maths or IB higher level. It involves
    complex numbers, parametric curves and implicit curves.

4.  Level four is aimed at people looked to develop motivation for
    university level material. It involves ODEs and PDEs.

Contribute
==========

There are several ways you can contribute:

If you are a student:

-   \* we would love feedback on the appropriacy and difficulty of the
    problems

Graduates:

-   attempt the problems to find any errors that may have slipped in

-   contribute interesting new problems
